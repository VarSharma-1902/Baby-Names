This is a GUI based application that uses
  - Java, for backend
  - JavaFX, for GUI controls
  
I had made this project while doing the course 'Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software' offered by the Duke University on Coursera. 
We had made a simple Java project during this course, while later on, I have added some GUI controls to make this application a bit more interactive.

The project uses a dataset that includes the different baby names in the United States from past several decades to offer the following functionalities:
  - find out the total number of births in a specific year or a decade
  - read a name and display it's rank in a particular year
  - read a rank and display the name corresponding to it in a particular year
  - check the name of a person in a specific year
  - find the year with the highest rank for a particular name
  - find the average rank of a particular name
